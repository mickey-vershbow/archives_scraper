# archives_scraper
A web scraper built using Node.js, Javascript, and Puppeteer. It is intended to be used as a scraper for the Wayback Machine and return data specific to that site, but can be modified to return different data and formats per the Puppeteer docs.

# Get Started
To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Open your 'terminal' (also known as the Command Line or CLI) by pressing 'ctrl-option-t'. You can close the debug console so the terminal has more space.
2. Make sure your terminal is in your "archives_scraper" folder. It should say "mickeyvershbow@Mickeys-MBP archives_scraper % ". If not, you need to move into the correct folder, shoot me a text and I'll show you how.
